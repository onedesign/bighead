# jQuery Bighead

### A little plugin for making better big headers

Just a little jQuery plugin whipped up for making some nicer headers that fill the screen based on some parameters

## Options
`minHeight` - The minimum height the effect will trigger on  
`maxHeight` - The maximum height the effect will trigger on  
`maxWidth` - The maximum width of the header  
`heightGap` - How much you'd like to see between the header and the bottom of the window  

## Example useage
See [the demo page](https://github.com/onedesign/bighead/blob/master/demo/index.html) for a super simple implementation
